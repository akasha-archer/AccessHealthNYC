## AccessHealthNYC (coming soon to Google Play) 

### Previous version available here >> https://github.com/akasha-archer/C4QHackathonApp

AccessHealth (in progress) provides uninsured and low income New Yorkers with a list of medical facilities that provide services on a sliding scale. It also includes a calculator that informs them of the cost for services--based on income level and family size--at NYC Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) facilities.

### Current Challenges & Improvements to Come:

- Difficulty getting data to display in recyclerview when using RxJava
- Sorting search results by distance to user's selected location.
- Database for user profile data (will use the Cupboard library). 
- Database for local data. Will look deeper into if storing data in a local database is better than using lists in the ViewModel.
- Room Database for HHC facility search results. Info is not likely to change frequently so this can easily be stored on the user's phone for more efficient retrieval.
- Room Database / LiveData for storing user's favorites.
- Language support: Include translations of the app in other popular langages spoken in NYC: Spanish, Russian, Chinese and French Creole
- Include Mental Health facilities
- Include Dental Health facilities
